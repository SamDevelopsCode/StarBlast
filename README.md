Technologies: Godot Engine
Languages: GDScript 2.0

This was my first foray into using the Godot Engine to make a small complete project. It taught me an immense amount of small learnings throughout the process not only about Godot itself but better programming practices as well. Things such as dependencies and how different architectures can create cleaner/more scalable solutions. This showed quite a bit about some of my perfectionism traits and how to manage them better to get things done. Not allowing my fear of not writing perfect code stop me from creating content and features. Overall it was a great time and I have since grown as a developer overall using this as the foundation on which I can stand on.

The game includes various powerups and 3 stages with 3 unique boss battles.
